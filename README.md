# Shop-Java-System

The Shop System is a project I completed as part of my University Programming 2 module coursework.

This Tool Hire Management System models and manages the operations of a shop that rents out various tools and equipment for one-off usage.

Key Java concepts and skills demonstrated in the project include:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Proficiently employed OOP principles such as interacting objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism to design a well-structured and maintainable system.
2. **Data Structures**: Effectively utilized Java's Collections Framework, employing ArrayLists, HashMaps, LinkedHashMaps, and LinkedHashSets for efficient data storage and retrieval.
3. **File Input/Output & File Selection Dialog**: Demonstrated the ability to read and write data from and to text files using Scanner and FileWriter.
4. **Exception Handling**: Implemented robust exception handling throughout the project, ensuring the application remains stable and user-friendly.
5. **Data Serialization**: Implemented data serialization techniques to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval.
6. **Input Validation**: Applied input validation techniques to ensure data corectness and consistency.

This project not only reinforced my Java programming skills but also allowed me to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios, providing a strong foundation for future software development endeavors.
